<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>

We present some mostly non-statistical notes on covariance. The notes work
towards some bounds on the proportion of overall covariance captured by subsets
of rows of a data matrix. We're interested in that because of
recent big data approaches that partition large data matrices along their rows.

<p>

These are working notes. We'll continue to tweak and revise them.

<h2>What is covariance?</h2>
<p>
Covariance is a matrix-valued function of a data matrix
$X\in\mathbb{R}^{m\times n}$,
$cov:\mathbb{R}^{m\times n} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$, defined as:
\[
cov(X) = \frac{1}{m-1}\left(X - e e^TX/m\right)^T\left(X - e e^TX/m\right),
\]
where $e = (1,1,\ldots,1)^T\in \mathbb{R}^m$. The expression
$e^TX/m$ produces a vector of column means of the matrix $X$,
and $X - ee^TX/m$ subtracts the mean from each column, returning a so-called
"centered" matrix with zero column means.
<p>
We think of the rows of the data matrix as independent observations or measurements
of some events or things, and the columns as features or variables that we can
measure.

<p>
We assume in this note that $m &gt; n$.

<h2>I.I.D. rows and row sampling</h2>

Assume that the rows of $X$ consist of $m$ independent observations of from the
same $n$-variate probability distribution. That is, assume that the rows are
independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.).

<p>
This means that we expect that subsets of the rows of the data matrix
have, on average, the same column means. Small samples of rows might deviate
from this, but in the long run the I.I.D. assumption means that these
deviations average out. Let's illustrate this simple idea with a short
example in R:

<pre>
library("mvtnorm")

# Generate a 500x2 matrix witn known covariance structure and IID rows:
set.seed(1)
sigma = matrix(c(4,2,2,3), ncol=2)
x     = rmvnorm(n=500, mean=c(1,2), sigma=sigma)

colMeans(x)
[1] 0.9492868 1.9916602

# Any one small sample might deviate from this:
colMeans(x[sample(500,20),])
[1] 1.206864 2.494555

# But, in the long run the deviations average out, even for small samples:
apply(replicate(100, colMeans(x[sample(500,20),])), 1, mean)
[1] 0.9520979 2.0058471
</pre>

Denote a matrix consisting of a sample of $k$ rows of $X$ by
$X_k\in\mathbb{R}^{k\times n}$.  A more formal way of stating our observation
about I.I.D. rows is that
\[
e^TX/m \approx e_k^TX_k/k,
\]
where $e_k = (1,1,\ldots,1)^T\in\mathbb{R}^k$.

Now assume that our data matrix $X$ has already been centered and its
column means are zero&mdash;that is, $e^TX/m=0$. Then
\[
cov(X) = \frac{1}{m-1}X^TX,
\qquad \mathrm{and,} \qquad
cov(X_k) \approx \frac{1}{k-1}X_k^TX_k.
\]
This note is interested in comparing $cov(X)$ with $cov(X_k)$ for various row
sampling sizes $k$.

<h2>How well does a sampling of rows of a data matrix capture the covariance of
the full matrix?</h2>

This is an interesting question for approaches that proceed by partitioning the
data matrix along its rows. Of course there are many ways we might compare the
covariance. Let's consider one somehwat coarse comparison that is particularly
easy to analyze:
\[
\frac{||cov(X_k)||}{||cov(X)||},
\]
where $||\cdot||$ indicates the spectral matrix norm.
